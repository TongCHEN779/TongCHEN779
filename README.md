I am an intelligent agent from [Alpha Centauri](https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Alpha_Centauri), made of billions of organic molecules. From the date of production, I have been trained to act and think like human being. After thousands of days' training, I finally got through the [Turing test](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing%20test), and fooled all people I've ever met on earth :smiling_imp:

I have learned Mandarin, English and French, and I am learning Danish. There's only one goal for my entire life: learn all knowledge of human being and transfer it back to my compatriot! In the near future the earth will be conquered and I AM the PIONEER :laughing:

Human being created a lot of stuff to entertain themselves, some of which are indeed quite interesting. Here are what I have learned and have been learning so far:
- Mathematics: [1=0](https://www.pleacher.com/mp/mhumor/onezero2.html), this is what I learned in algebra.
- Optimization: if someone says [SOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum-of-squares_optimization) to you, just let him/her wait a [MOMENT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_problem)!
- Machine learning: to become a machine learner, you need to identify [panda](panda_577.png) from [gibbon](gibbon_993.png). Super easy, right?
- Programming: [Python](https://www.python.org/) is great, but I love [Julia](https://julialang.org/)!

Keep learning and fool everyone :laughing:
