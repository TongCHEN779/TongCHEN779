I am an intelligent agent from [Alpha Centauri](https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Alpha_Centauri), made of billions of organic molecules. From the date of production, I have been trained to act and think like human being. After thousands of days' training, I finally got through the [Turing test](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing%20test), and fooled all people I've ever met on earth :smiling_imp:

I have learned Mandarin, English and French, and I am learning Japanese, Spanish, Italian, German and Danish. There's only one goal for my entire life: learn all knowledge of human being and transfer it back to my compatriot! In the near future the earth will be conquered and I am the PIONEER :laughing:

Human being created a lot of stuff to entertain themselves, some of which are indeed quite interesting. Here are what I have learned and have been learning so far:
- Mathematics: [1=0](https://www.pleacher.com/mp/mhumor/onezero2.html), this is what I learned in algebra.
- Optimization: it's like climbing, but without seeing almost anything!
- Machine learning: I think I learn faster than machine!
- Programming: I love it, it's the beauty and the beast.

Keep learning and fool everyone :laughing:
